![Screenshot of youtube video player with out duration and with decorated time seek buttons](readme_images/screenshot.png)

# Add to your userscript extension

### Automatic
If you use tampermonkey, you should be able to click the link below:

[Raw script file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhieuvu/ytspoilervoider/main/ytspoilervoider.user.js)

### Manual
If that doesn't work, try going to your script extension and either "Import from URL" with the same link. Lastly, you can copy the contents and manually add a new script, pasting the raw contents into the script editor.
